Take the following steps to create a world from these files:
-Download the Bedrock Dedicated Server
-Unzip it into an empty directory
-Make necessary changes to server.properties
-Make a new directory with the name of your world
-Copy all of the Bedrock Dedicated Server files(from the zip file) into the new directory
-*If this is going to be a brand new world, skip to the last step*
-Make a new directory inside the new world directory called worlds/<worldname>/db
-Copy the db directory inside the original world files to the brand new db directory
-Run "export WORLDNAME=<worldname>" and "bash server-setup-v3.sh"
