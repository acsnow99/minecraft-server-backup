I would recommend backing up your worlds after finishing playing every day

-Go to file explorer
-Select the “view” tab and select “Hidden Items” check box
-Go into C:\Users\dmsno\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds
-AppData folder by default is hidden.
-Select all world folders(with names of random letters and numbers)
-Drag them into the Drive folder
-Drive will auto-update the world files
